    ABOUT: 'About me',

    PREHISTORY_STORY: `
        When I was a kid, I had a superpower to create any objects, not existed
        before: interstellar shuttles, space stations, whole cities. The only
        thing that could stop me was limited amount of LEGO details.
                                        |
        You are quite right: this is a story about how programming has become
        for me a constructor LEGO with infinite number of details of any shape,
        size, and color :)
                                        |
        I dived into the Web at the times when a table layout was an usual
        practice, tag &lt;font&gt; wasn't looked as a savage anachromism, and
        jQuery was a core of almost any website. Though with the last one is all
        stable..
                                        |
        The first significant textbook in my arms was Matt Zandstra's self-teach
        PHP5 manual. Denwer (and after - standard bundle PHP + MySQL + Apache)
        cluttered up my PC with training projects (if you allow me to name them
        so).
                                        |
        The violence against the PHP lasted until the moment I got a
        seven-hundred page AJAX textbook (now it causes a smile). So, my
        acquaintance with the world of JavaScript started with hacks like
        &lt;iframe&gt; and &lt;img&gt; for AJAX-request imitation.. However, a
        possibility to do the same thing in different ways only whipped up an
        interest.
                                        |
        There have been a lot of books and articles since that time. After years
        I found Node.js and deeply breathed out: the epoch of bicycle
        constructioning finished, cleared the way for learning libraries and
        frameworks.
                                        |
        It only remains to add, predicting a possible question, why am I still
        not even a Junior: programming has always been a hobby, relaxation, and
        creativity for me. But that's a completely different story :)
    `,
    EDUCATION_AND_EXPERIENCE: 'Education and commercial experience',
    EDUCATION_AND_EXPERIENCE_STORY: `
        To explain why by the age of ${AGE} I haven't got a higher education or
        any commercial programming experience... While most of HR-s are closing
        the current browser tab, I'll try.
                                        |
        It so happens, that only by now in my closest future plans is to get
        the higher education. Not to accept the concept of "crusts" is a
        honorable stuff, but not always justified in fact.
                                        |
        All human beings are different, in a different way understand themselves
        and what do they really need and want. That's the whole answer. Despite
        such an infantilism, I've always thought education as an extremely
        important part of a personality development, and have never stopped in
        that direction.
                                        |
        I've never thought about programming professionally, reasoning for
        myself the choise of simple primitive jobs by unwillingness to make one
        of my favourite activity and hobby a daily routine.
                                        |
        But I think, all is much simplier: the brain inclines to
        self-justification for saving resources, and in the deep of my mind I
        was just afraid of confessing to myself in a lack of knowledge and
        skills.
                                        |
        Times have changed, and my feelings too. There is a sort of adventurous 
        romance in that chasing a long time ago gone train; anyway, nobody
        still has explained me why it could be too late sometime.
